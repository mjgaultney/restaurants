# restaurants

<h4>Editing code with GraphiQL<h4>

<h2>Project Objective</h3>
  
Set up GraphQL for your restaurant data and then add mutations to get and update these data.

To accomplish this task, you need to implement the following methods under the “root” object: 

restaurant: This gets a single restaurant based on a provided ID. 
restaurants: This gets a list of all restaurants. 
setrestaurant: This creates a new restaurant. 
Deleterestaurant: This deletes a restaurant based on the provided id.
editrestaurant: This updates a restaurant based on the provided id.

<h2>Future updates</h2>
No future updates for this however it is a lot of fun to play around with.
